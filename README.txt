## Overview

This is a "complete AWS CloudFormation template" for
running the MyBB application on a scalable, highly-available and secure infrastructure.

### Running the stack

To run this project in an AWS Account do the following:

- Create an EC2 KeyPair (required for SSH access);
- Launch a stack from this template with CloudFormation;
- ...Have fun for sometime, but watch the events regularly for the progress...
- Go to the URL in the "WWWBalancerDNSName" output variable for the live MyBB application.
